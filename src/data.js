    info:
      "The olive tree, Olea europaea, is an evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds 8–15 m in height. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring 4–10 cm  long and 1–3 cm  wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted. The small, white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves.",

      "The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a corm. Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for trees, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted",

    company: "Coffea Arabica",

    info:
      "The caffeine in coffee beans serves as a toxic substance protecting the seeds of the plant, a form of natural plant defense against herbivory. Caffeine simultaneously attracts pollinators, specifically honeybees, by creating an olfactory memory that signals bees to return to the plant's flowers.[7] Not all Coffea species contain caffeine, in fact the earliest species either had little to no caffeine content. Caffeine has evolved independently in multiple lineages of Coffea in Africa, perhaps in response to high pest predation in the humid environments of West-Central Africa.[7] Caffeine has also evolved independently in the more distantly related genera Theobroma (cacao) and Camellia (tea).[8] This suggests that caffeine production is an adaptive trait in coffee and plant evolution. Fruits and leaves also contain caffeine, and can be used to make a tea. (See: Coffee cherry tea) The fruit is also used in many brands of soft drink as well as pre-packaged tea",

    info:
      "Coffee beans grow on a bush. They are actually the pit of a berry, which makes them a fruit. There are two main varieties of beans, green and red. Red beans have anicer smell and are less acidic. Red beans are used to produce lighter coffees. The longer that coffee beans have been roasted – the healthier they are. Decaffeinated coffee comes from a chemical process where the caffeine is taken out of the beans.  The caffeine is then often sold to Coca-Cola.",
